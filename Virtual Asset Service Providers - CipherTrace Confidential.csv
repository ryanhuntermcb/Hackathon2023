Predominantly supports BTC. BL3P is a product of Bitonic, an experienced Bitcoin company founded in 2012 as the first Bitcoin-company in the Netherlands. BL3P is available in all European countries and proclaims itself as the only cryptocurrency exchange based in the Netherlands that holds Dutch bank accounts to process euro transactions. It also has applied for a license at the DNB (Dutch Central Bank). BL3P is developed and maintained by ""Bitonic B.V."". Applicable law: Dutch.In a bold move, Bitonic objected and a Dutch court has ruled in favor of Bitonic in April 2021, stating it no longer needs to fulfill crypto wallet-verification requirements implemented by the De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), the central bank of the Netherlands, reversing earlier DNB requirement to verify the destination and originator's wallets for all transactions. The Dutch Central Bank has increased flexibility towards crypto-serivce providers, which must continue screening transactions, but are allowed to assess for themselves which transactions impose a high risk, such as money laundering, thus it will no longer be necessary to conduct the same intensive check for each transaction as previously required. https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/20/dutch-court-rules-bitonic-no-longer-requires-crypto-wallet-verification/ and https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=3384d144-dfc7-4010-853d-3027fc480a24"

The city police are saying that the top exchange executives manipulated the cryptocurrency prices on the exchange from August 2019 to May 2020.https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/seoul-police-indicted-coinbit-executives-for-market-manipulation/Coinbit is a Korean cryptocurrency exchange operating since July 2018. Supports both fiat-crypto trading and crypto-to-crypto trading. Cryptocurrency prices are denominated in local KRW (Korean Won), while fiat deposits must also be in KRW. Terms of service are available only in the local language (Korean) possibly a language barrier for anyone else wishing to transact. Services are prohibited for US residents. According to regulations that went into effect in March 2021, Korean crypto-exchanges are required to partner with banks to issue real-name account to exchange users. However, the compliance burden on banks has made the traditional financial sector hesitant to partner with exchanges out of fear of sanctions. Only a handful of the top crypto-exchanges in South Korea (Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone and Korbit) have been able to abide by the regulators and secure banking partners.

It is an online platform that enables all the Koinal users to purchase cryptocurrencies and making their payments with credit- and debit cards.They connect the online card payments infrastructure with Fiat payments and banking infrastructure to enable crypto purchases using credit and debit cards. Crypto is still fairly new in the financial world. As it becomes more and more regulated, the adoption and acceptance of it by users will get easier. SEPA and Swift transfers are still the most commonly used ways of payment when buying cryptocurrencies. However, users choosing to pay with one of these two methods have to go through a lengthy process before completing their payments. Even if you manage to complete a bank transfer without a problem, you’ll have to wait at least 1 working day to be able to use that money. What Koinal does is, they give you the opportunity to pay with either your credit or debit card, instantly. The key points here are instant purchases and the ability to use credit or debit cards instead of waiting for a money transfer. It seriously is a difficult process to integrate a crypto purchase structure from a bank using credit cards. Thanks to the capable and hardworking people in our group, they claim to be able to provide this extremely complicated yet crucial service to our customers. This way they are also keeping most of the costs to the minimum and this is reflecting our customers in the form of next to nothing fees and great prices.They are providing the checkout service of Koinal to more than 52+ partner exchanges such as Huobi, Stormgain, Okex... all around the world. Their partners offer their users a fast, simple, and secure way of cryptocurrency purchase via the Koinal payment method. Furthermore, they claim in managing to complete the whole purchasing process in just a few minutes. That is one of the main aspects of their fast transactions."

INVERSE is a non-custodial, counter volatile, DeFi platform that allows users to conveniently take advantage of the downward moves of selected DeFi assets (i.e. COMP, AAEV, UNI, YFI) by utilizing various 'tracking valuts' on the platform. INVERSE is powered by the XIV token, a free-floating, inverse-yielidng, ERC20 token, which is used to unlock these 'tracking vaults'. Merchants earn XIV for each transaction they facilitate. Traders earn XIV by rating the Merchants following each transaction, and through referral bonuses. Kudi Pro's Terms and Conditions do not specifically state who operates this platform.
